    INFORMATION: You can add any custom log adapter here. This would be

    ComputeAgents. This will allow you to create multiple log adapters
    that utilize different logback.xml loggers/appenders.
    Look below to the commented out code. You can also have access
    to the underlying default 'log' variable created by the base
    ActorLogging trait that this one extends.
